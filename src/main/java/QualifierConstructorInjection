@Qualifier is a nice feature, but it is tricky when used with Constructors.

The syntax is much different from other examples and not exactly intuitive.  
Consider this the "deep end of the pool" when it comes to Spring configuration LOL :-)

 You have to place the @Qualifier annotation inside of the constructor arguments. 

Here's an example from our classroom example. 
I updated it to make use of constructor injection, with @Autowired and @Qualifier. 
Make note of the code in bold below:

@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {

    private FortuneService fortuneService;
    
    @Autowired
    public TennisCoach(@Qualifier("randomFortuneService") FortuneService theFortuneService) {

        System.out.println(">> TennisCoach: inside constructor using @autowired and @qualifier");
        
        fortuneService = theFortuneService;
    }

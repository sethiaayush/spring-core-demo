Special Note about @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy Method Signatures

I want to provide additional details regarding the method signatures of @PostContruct and @PreDestroy methods.

Access modifier

The method can have any access modifier (public, protected, private)

Return type
The method can have any return type. However, "void' is most commonly used. 
If you give a return type just note that you will not be able to capture the return value. 
As a result, "void" is commonly used.

Method name
The method can have any method name.

Arguments
The method can  not accept any arguments. The method should be no-arg.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a subtle point you need to be aware of with "prototype" scoped beans.

For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the @PreDestroy method.  Gasp!  

I didn't know this either until I dug through the Spring reference manual researching a student's question.

Here is the answer from the Spring reference manual. Section 7.5.2

https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-factory-scopes-prototype

---

In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a
prototype bean: the container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a
prototype object, and hands it to the client, with no further record of that prototype
instance. 

Thus, although initialization life-cycle callback methods are called on all objects regardless of scope, 
in the case of prototypes, configured destruction life-cycle callbacks are not called. 
The client code must clean up prototype-scoped objects and release expensive resources that the prototype bean(s) are holding. 

To get the Spring container to release resources held by prototype-scoped beans, 
try using a custom bean post-processor, which holds a reference to beans that need to be cleaned up.

This also applies to XML configuration.
